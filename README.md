# Advent of code 2020 :santa: :christmas_tree:
This is my attemp at solving 2020's edition of advent of code. My solutions are written in **JavaScript** running on Node.js.

:loudspeaker: I am currently looking for a job! Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tmmluis/).

## What is Advent of Code
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles created by [Eric Wastl](https://github.com/topaz).
Each day, starting on December 1st, a puzzle is released which you can solve using any programming language you like and will test a variety of skill sets and skill levels.

Each puzzle is divided in two parts. The second part is unlocked when you finish the first part and each part grants one gold star. To save your vacation, you need to get all fifty stars by December 25th. Good luck!

## Quickstart

To download and run this repository:

```git clone https://github.com/tmmluis/advent-of-code-2020.git
npm install
npm start
```

Each puzzle has its own set of tests (I am using [Mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha)). You can run them by typing:

```npm test
```
